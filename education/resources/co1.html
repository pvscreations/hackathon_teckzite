		<h1>Cover Letter</h1>
		<div class="div1"><p>Job seekers frequently send a cover letter along with their curriculum vitae or applications for employment as a way of introducing themselves to potential employers and explaining their suitability for the desired positions.[2] Employers may look for individualized and thoughtfully written cover letters as one method of screening out applicants who are not sufficiently interested in their positions and/or lack the necessary basic skills.[1]

Cover letters are typically categorized according to two purposes:

applying for a specific, advertised opening ('letter of application'),
expressing interest in an organization when the job seeker is uncertain whether there are current openings ('letter of inquiry').[3]
According to studies, a good cover letter should:

be specific and up-to-date,
be well punctuated and spelled, and grammatically correct. It should be free of mistakes and typos,[4]
use timelines to highlight chronological information,
reference to the latest job positions, most closely related to the position for which one is demanding,[5][6]
contain numbers (stark facts highlight one's achievements).</p>
