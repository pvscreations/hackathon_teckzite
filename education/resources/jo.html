	<div class="div1"><p>Contacting as many people as possible is a highly effective way to find a job. It is estimated that 50% or higher of all jobs are found through networking.[2]

Job recruiters and decision makers are increasingly using online social networking sites to gather information about job applicants, according to a mid-2011 Jobvite survey of 800 employers in the US.[3] Likewise, job seekers are beginning to use social networking sites to advertise their skills and post resumes. Today, job seekers can use resources such as Google+’s Circles, Facebook’s BranchOut, LinkedIn’s InMaps, and Twitter’s Lists to make employers notice them in a unique way.[4] In 2014, using these social media networks has led to 1 of 6 job seekers finding employment.[5]

A study by Microsoft suggests that job seekers need to begin to pay more attention to what employers and recruiters want in their pre-interview information gathering process and be able to deliver those aspects which essentially are different from their qualifications on résumé, and specific to the built organizational culture for their strategic outcomes.</p>
